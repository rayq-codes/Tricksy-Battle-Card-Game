# My Program
- a programed card game


## How to run this
- run using python command


## What it does
- The numbers to suit postions (Ace = 1, J = 11, Q = 12)
- Creates a deck 
- Dandomizes/shuffles the deck with "random.shuffle(deck)"
    "print(deck)" to check radomized deck
- Deal 8 cards to each player
    "print(player1, player2)" to check if deck is 8 to each player
- Set other variables to 0, like player points, rounds played
- The while loop runs rounds of the game by having the leader play a card, the follower respond (trying to match the suit), then both hands update as the game progresses until all cards are played.
- It checks who wins the round based on suit and value, gives winner a point, and sets them as the next round leader.
- Reveal a card from deck, Deal 4 new cards to each if both players have 4 cards left and deck allows, Increment round counter and determine winner, print final results, game results and 
- Added an ealry game breaker/ender when one player reaches = 9 points and the oppsoing has only 1
- Implemented the "Ending the game" rules and fixed up any bugs
- Me and a peer added user input, turn-by-turn narration, and round-by-round play, instead of the started randomizer that allowed all 16 rounds to be played at once
